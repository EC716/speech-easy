# Original Audio Database

This folder should be used to copy the orignal audio recordings to the local
project folder. This enables the scripts within this project to use a 
relative path instead of getting bogged down with machine dependent paths.

Do NOT add any audio file to the git repo directly. These have been explicitly
ignored from git status because they are binary large objects that do not
work well with version control.
